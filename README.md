# 🎙️ Vocal Hash Protocol (VHP)

**[ProofOfVoice.io](https://ProofOfVoice.io)** – Official Repository  
*A Bitcoin-native timestamping protocol for voice, authorship, and human originality.*

Created by **Juan Andre Molina**, the Vocal Hash Protocol (VHP) leverages cryptographic hashing and the Bitcoin blockchain to preserve, verify, and anchor vocal creations with unforgeable proof of authorship and time.

## 💡 About VHP

> "The whole purpose of Bitcoin is to create space blocks to hold real digital value from humans."

VHP redefines authorship by treating your voice as original code — worthy of permanence and protection. The blockchain doesn’t just timestamp. It remembers.

## 🛠️ Coming Soon

- `.vhp` file standard documentation  
- Open-source timestamping CLI tools  
- Integration guides for creators, producers, and developers  
- Inheritance protocol for long-term archival and legacy claims
